# Model View Control: Tech Blog

## Task
```
For this challenge, I was given the task of building a text editor that runs in the browser.
This app is a single-page application that meets the PWA criteria. Additionally, it features 
a number of data persistence technioques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options 
is not supported by the browser. The application also functions offline.
